# FYP2020

## Important Notes
The data path that we will be using is `~/../../mnt/external2/tunjian/`. This is the external HDD. Professor has stated the path incorrectly in the email. The correct directory path is stated in the manual. For all `FYP` related videos, they should be placed in the `fyp_video_data` under the path `../../mnt/external2/tunjian/`. For the dataset from other work, please place them in their respective folders. Please name them accordingly. One thing to note is that the writing speed to the HDD is very slow. Thus use `screen` to run your download script. Plus be patient.
